			Happy birthday to the best person out there!! Indeed words are less to describe how much we all love and miss you. You have always inspired us in different ways encouraging us to get indulged in so many activities. Thank you for being the superman in our life. You’ve always made us feel special with your love and care. You’ve given us each and everything that we had wished for….from the toys we asked for to all those amazing gifts and the amazing trips u’ve taken us to.

			Do you remember those days when we would go to lulu n u would always buy me sweets, cakes and chips and my favorite noodles from the food corner…and you would get us all the clothes n shoes we wanted from avenues…and obviously you would take us to our all time favorite restaurants for lunch: ))))) also those amazing trips to Kuwait magic.. You would buy me all my favorite donuts :0 Also the trip to USA was one of the best trips….we got to see so many things and we learnt so much from all of that… you indeed have done so much for all of us! We are so glad to have an amazing father like you…you’ve fulfilled all our wishes and we hope that someday we could do the same.
